        <div class="subheading mb-5">Assistant to the Regional Manager ðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">From a young age, I have been restless to explore the world around me. 
        Most importantly, I took an interest in people. I enjoyed watching my peers and often found myself thinking about their actions. 
        After reaching high school I learned about the field of psychology and found that the class thought many of the same concepts I had raveled my mind around.
        Entering college, I turned to psychology as my major, eager to explore any and find a specialty. I took a variety of psychology courses
        that differed in my level of interest. I know now that I am passionate about children's psychology.   <br><br>
        
        I currently hold two jobs in which I work with special needs kids. I began my first job at Inland Respite, inc. which offers close in person experience with 
        those who are disabled whether it be cognitively or physically. At Inland Respite, the primary goal is to relieve a family from the duties of taking care of 
        their family member for a few hours and come back refreshed. It has become very clear that Inland Respite serves to preserve the mental health of many of the 
        families for whom we work for. Entering the job, I chose to work with young adults with autism and through interactions have come to understand their unique 
        way of processing the world. It is often difficult to communicate with children of special needs, and this has brought about the understanding of how important
        body language is for communication. 
        I believe working with children with special needs has given me an incredible view on the field of psychology. 
        <br><br>

        My second job is with IHSS, this job also pertains to the care of special needs individuals. As an in-home supportive service worker, I spend a lot of time with 
        children who have cerebral palsy and autism. Holding this second job has given me the opportunity to learn about cognition since I work with children that 
        lie on different parts of the autism spectrum. One of the biggest advantages of working with special needs children is the gained perspective of language and 
        communication one obtains. Having worked with special needs children, I find it easier to communicate with and understand the non-verbal cues of children with 
        no developmental issues. I think the mind of a child is fascinating and artistic in nature and there is no doubt that their way of processing the world differs from
        adults. I find child psychology to be fascinating and hope to quench my thirst for learning by exploring careers in cognitive psychology.
